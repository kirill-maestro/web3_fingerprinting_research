# web3_fingerprinting_research
Researching how dapps track the users web2 &amp; web3 analysis. 

Here is the code of the script that I created to do the seminar for my Master studies at TUM. 

This study investigates user tracking mechanisms in decentralized applications, focusing on the intersection of traditional web tracking and blockchain transparency. Through analysis of 30 popular dapps, we found that 63.3% implement some form of tracking, with Google Analytics being the most prevalent (53.3%). We identify a concerning trend where specialized Web3 analytics solutions like Cookie3 (adopted by 10% of examined dapps) aim to correlate blockchain wallet addresses with browser fingerprints, potentially compromising user privacy. Our research reveals how the combination of browser fingerprinting and public blockchain data creates a "persistent identity bridge," enabling unprecedented user profiling across Web2 and Web3 ecosystems. While major protocols like Uniswap and Balancer show no tracking implementation, the emergence of Web3-specific analytics tools signals potential privacy challenges. We present technical analysis of tracking methodologies, discuss regulatory implications, and propose privacy-preserving recommendations for both users and developers.
